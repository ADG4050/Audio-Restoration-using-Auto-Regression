# Audio-Restoration-MATLAB
Audio Restoration using Auto Regression Method
This code was developed for purely academic purposes by (ADG4050) as part of the module of Computational Methods (5c22) in Trinity College Dublin

Refer the Report provided, which describes the algorithm and the MATLAB code designed for detection and removal of clicks in degraded audio tracks. The sample clean audio undertaken for this project is a ten
seconds clip, which is then degraded artificially and restored again. The restored clip is then compared to the original clean clip and different performance analysis charts, graphs and tables
are plotted.

Installation
1) MATLAB : Version R2021b
2) Download the wav files and keep them in the same directory as the MATLAB files.
3) Download the .m function files and keep them in the same directory as the main MATLAB file.
4) Run the MATALB demo.m file through Editor and check graphs
5) Observe the values thoeugh the command section
6) To play the audios, execute the command in the command section "sound (restored, Fs)" for restored.wav
